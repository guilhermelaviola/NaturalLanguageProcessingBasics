# NaturalLanguageProcessingBasics
The basic concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) exemplified based on the content I've been studying in college.

NLP:

STEMMING AND LEMMATIZATION

Both have something in common: they convert a word to its base form.
Example:
Do (Doing, Does, Done, etc...)

Stemming and Lemmatization are used to reduce the amount of training data that we would need to train our models.

Stemming: The base form of the word will NOT make sense. It's used widely, more than Lemmatization. There are many Stemming algorithms.

Stemming algorithms:
- PorterStemmer
- Lancaster
- Snowball

Lemmatization: The base form of the word will make sense. It's not very widely used and requires a lot of work. It's necessary to have a lot of knowledge of the language you're working with in order to use Lemmatization.
